# Finding edgepoints of line - CNN
Project which main task was creating convolutional neural network for finding edgepoints of thin line at the 64x64 images.

If you want to create new model, please use WalkseeTask_neuralNetwork.ipynb.

If you want to test trained models, please use Load_and_test_model.ipynb file. Please check and enter the correct model name in load_model('') function.

More information soon...
